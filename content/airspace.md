## How to open a box

- Before you fly within Tromso CTR, **make sure your box is open**.
  The control tower can be reached via 67 03 47 66.
- **Before calling the tower and opening a box, make sure nobody else has opened it already**
  otherwise it makes the club look uncoordinated. Please check [Telegram group "THPK flyboks"](https://t.me/joinchat/RF54vlM7r-WYjzLDKXSRAQ).
- **Once you open a box, post it on Telegram** group ["THPK flyboks"](https://t.me/joinchat/RF54vlM7r-WYjzLDKXSRAQ) so that others know.
  Post which box, which altitude limit, until what time, and your contact.
- **Have your radio on** set to 154.175 so that you can inform others about changes.
- If you plan to close the box earlier, make sure nobody is in the air or about
  to launch and send other pilots 10-15 minutes warning.

Example conversation:

> You: This is (your name) and I would like to fly paraglider in the box (name of the box) until 16:00 local time. Is this possible?
