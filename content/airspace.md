## How to open a box

- Before you fly within Tromso CTR, **make sure your box is open**.
- To get the telephone number to the tower, please first join the [Signal group "THPK flyboks"](@/contact.md) and ask there.
- **Before calling the tower and opening a box, make sure nobody else has opened it already**
  otherwise it makes the club look uncoordinated. Please check the [Signal group "THPK flyboks"](@/contact.md).
- **Once you open a box, post it on the Signal** group ["THPK flyboks"](@/contact.md) so that others know.
  Post which box, which altitude limit, until what time, and your contact.
- **Have your radio on** set to 154.175 so that you can inform others about changes.
- If you plan to close the box earlier, make sure nobody is in the air or about
  to launch and send other pilots 10-15 minutes warning.

Example conversation:

> You: This is (your name) and I would like to fly paraglider in the box (name of the box) until 16:00 local time. Is this possible?

> Tower: Yes this is possible, you can have the (name of the box) until 16:00 local time with altitude 2000 ft and below.

> You: Confirming 2000 ft and below until 16:00. My contact number is (your telephone number).

> Tower: Please call if you finish earlier.
