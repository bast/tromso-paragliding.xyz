launches:
  - name: South start
    angle: -90
    lat: 69.633145
    lon: 18.990738
    notes:
      Lots of space here. Good on SW or W wind.
  - name: North start
    angle: 0
    lat: 69.636169
    lon: 18.998
    notes:
      Right next to the antenna. Works for NW, N, even slightly NE wind.
      This is one of our main launches. You can either take the cable car
      up or walk up sherpatrappa.
  - name: Ersfjord
    angle: 90
    lat: 69.7006255
    lon: 18.6356585
    notes:
      Great site on E wind, especially in winter and early spring. Requires 4-6 m/s to hang. If you drop
      below launch, head to landing and don't try to scratch up.
      On S wind this is not a good place. If the wind is strong enough to stay
      up, you are then probably in a rotor.
  - name: Finnvikdalen launch
    angle: -45
    lat: 69.760482
    lon: 18.853783
    notes:
      Ideally on W to NW wind. Above 4-5 m/s the mountain to the right provides
      a beautiful soaring space. The valley provides lot of space to explore and
      land.
  - name: Floya north
    angle: 90
    lat: 69.6201959
    lon: 19.000064
    notes:
      N or NE wind. Watch out for the high-power electricity line running below
      the launch.  After launch head for the antenna.
  - name: Floya south
    angle: 220
    lat: 69.6199724
    lon: 18.9981473
    notes:
      After launch swing right and head for the south start.
  - name: Floya east
    angle: 120
    lat: 69.6181481
    lon: 18.9978354
    notes:
      There is a little rock/ledge where it is possible to launch on E wind.
      After launch swing left and follow the slope to the left.  Watch out for
      the high-power electricity line and head for the antenna.

landings:
  - name: TIRB
    lat: 69.641227
    lon: 18.978109
    notes:
      This is the main landing on this site.  It is close to the cable car.  It
      is small but there is some space if you overshoot.  Easier to land from
      south than from north.  On strong west wind the place can be very
      turbulent and in this case either try to top-land or rather go to
      Mandelasletta. Watch out for the fence next to the wind-sock.  Also use
      the flags on top of the supermarket as wind indication.
      In afternoons a strong sea-breeze can set in.  If you see white-caps on
      the water, don't fly since you risk to be blown back.
      Also watch out for the big electricity trafo station a bit to the south.
  - name: Mandelasletta
    lat: 69.650857
    lon: 18.991451
    notes:
      A lot of space. Basically 3 football fields large. We use this landing in
      courses but nothing speaks against using it also after the course.
      In afternoons a strong sea-breeze can set in.  If you see white-caps on
      the water, don't fly since you risk to be blown back.
  - name: Ersfjord landing
    lat: 69.697589
    lon: 18.631767
    notes:
      Behind the house, typically landing from west towards east.  The landing
      is big and easy but it is really the only landing (other than
      top-landing).  Beach is not a good landing as there are cables
      everywhere.  Biggest risk is the cable running down from the antenna. If
      you are below launch, set up for landing and don't scratch otherwise you
      risk getting too low to clear the cable.  If wind turns south and picks
      up and you realize you won't make it to the landing, a backup landing is
      north of the launch, at the shore.
  - name: Little parking
    lat: 69.764473
    lon: 18.844769
    notes:
      Typically approached from east to west.  Watch out it's sloped and you
      will very likely overshoot it.
  - name: Top parking
    lat: 69.759861
    lon: 18.854284
    notes:
      Popular landing when conditions allow to lift/hang.
      Sometimes cars park left and right.
      Try a rectangular approach in front of the cables.
  - name: Marsh ("myra")
    lat: 69.768239
    lon: 18.842442
    notes:
      You can land a 474 here. Almost. We use this during the course.  It can
      be wet and in summer it can be full of flies and mosquitoes.  It can make
      sense to walk up to the parking and either pack there or hope for
      retrieve to drive you back up to launch.
