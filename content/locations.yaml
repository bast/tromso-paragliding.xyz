landings:
  - name: TIRB
    lat: 69.641227
    lon: 18.978109
    notes:
      This is the main landing on this site.  It is close to the cable car.  It
      is small but there is some space if you overshoot.  Easier to land from
      south than from north.  On strong west wind the place can be very
      turbulent and in this case either try to top-land or rather go to
      Mandelasletta. Watch out for the fence next to the wind-sock.  Also use
      the flags on top of the supermarket as wind indication.
      In afternoons a strong sea-breeze can set in.  If you see white-caps on
      the water, don't fly since you risk to be blown back.
  - name: Mandelasletta
    lat: 69.650857
    lon: 18.991451
    notes:
      A lot of space. Basically 3 football fields large. We use this landing in
      courses but nothing speaks against using it also after the course.
      In afternoons a strong sea-breeze can set in.  If you see white-caps on
      the water, don't fly since you risk to be blown back.
  - name: Ersfjord landing
    lat: 69.697589
    lon: 18.631767
    notes:
      Behind the house, typically landing from west towards east.  The landing
      is big and easy but it is really the only landing (other than
      top-landing).  Beach is not a good landing as there are cables
      everywhere.  Biggest risk is the cable running down from the antenna. If
      you are below launch, set up for landing and don't scratch otherwise you
      risk getting too low to clear the cable.  If wind turns south and picks
      up and you realize you won't make it to the landing, a backup landing is
      north of the launch, at the shore.
  - name: Little parking
    lat: 69.764473
    lon: 18.844769
    notes:
      Typically approached from east to west.  Watch out it's sloped and you
      will very likely overshoot it.
  - name: Top parking
    lat: 69.759861
    lon: 18.854284
    notes:
      Popular landing when conditions allow to lift/hang.
      Sometimes cars park left and right.
      Try a rectangular approach in front of the cables.
  - name: Huge landing
    lat: 69.768239
    lon: 18.842442
    notes:
      You can land a 474 here. Almost. We use this during the course.  It can
      be wet and in summer it can be full of flies and mosquitoes.  It can make
      sense to walk up to the parking and either pack there or hope for
      retrieve to drive you back up to launch.
