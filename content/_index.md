# Tromsø paragliding

Goal of this page is to make paragliding safer and more fun for pilots visiting
Tromsø who might not have local knowledge and want to get access to information
and resources that we have and use locally.

This page is not a replacement for the [THPK club website](http://thpk.no).  I
created this page with the goal of providing something I wish I had when
traveling to other places and wanting to fly.

The information here comes without any guarantees. Please verify the sources.
I have gathered information about airspace from <http://thpk.no> and
<http://luftrom.info/>.

**You can click on the symbols on the map** to get information about launches and
landing sites.
