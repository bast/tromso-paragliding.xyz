# Tromsø paragliding

Goal of this page is to make paragliding safer and more fun for pilots visiting
Tromsø and new pilots who might not have local knowledge (yet) and want to get
access to information and resources that we have and use locally.

This page is not a replacement for the [Tromsø hang- og paragliderklubb (THPK)
club website](http://thpk.no).  I created this page with the goal of providing
something I wish I had when traveling to other places and wanting to fly.

The information here comes **without any guarantees. Please verify the sources**.
I have gathered information about airspace from <http://thpk.no> and
<http://luftrom.info/>. All other information is from own experience.

**You can click on the symbols on the map below** to get information about launches and
landing sites.
