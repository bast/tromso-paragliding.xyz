## Are you a visiting pilot who would like to fly withing Tromsø CTR?

We ask you to fly with a local or at least have a conversation with
a local to make sure we all use the airspaces correctly since
this is an arrangement between the authorities and the THPK club.

We ask you to not contact the Tromsø tower without contacting
the club first.

Let's make paragliding safer and more fun for pilots visiting
Tromsø and new pilots who might not have local knowledge (yet) and want to get
access to information and resources that we have and use locally.

This page is not a replacement for the [Tromsø hang- og paragliderklubb (THPK)
club website](https://thpk.no).  I created this page with the goal of providing
something I wish I had when traveling to other places and wanting to fly.

The information here comes **without any guarantees. Please verify the sources**.
I have gathered information about airspace from <https://thpk.no> and
<https://luftrom.info/>. All other information is from own experience.

**You can click on the symbols on the map** to get information about launches,
landing sites, and airspace boxes.
