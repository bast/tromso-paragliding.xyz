# Wind and weather


## Holfuy stations

These anemometer stations are positioned very close to the main launches and
are our main source of data:
<https://holfuy.com/no/map/wind&la=69.70303&lo=18.72439&z=9.0>.
Many local pilots have the phone app installed where there is a useful tabular
overview with 15 min or 1 hour granularity and it is recommended to look at the
development and not only at the value right now.


## METAR data

- <https://metar-taf.com/history/ENTC>

On this page look at the right column under "METAR/SPECI". The interesting value is the last entry in each row.

For example let us look at this entry:
```
METAR ENTC 281050Z 06004KT 030V110 9999 FEW016 BKN022
OVC044 10/07 Q1017 NOSIG RMK WIND 2600FT 32014KT
```

Here the interesting part is the last part: `32014KT` This means that it's 14 knots with wind
from 320 degrees. The wind station is located at `2600FT` [at the top of
Kjølen](https://norgeskart.no/#!?project=norgeskart&layers=1002&zoom=10&lat=7735943.68&lon=648327.31&markerLat=7740715.707866439&markerLon=646317.8149576897&p=searchOptionsPanel&sok=Stor-Kj%C3%B8len).
This reading gives a good idea of what wind to expect higher up. It often also
gives a good idea on how the wind is on [top of
Fløya](https://norgeskart.no/#!?project=norgeskart&layers=1002&zoom=12&lat=7729925.28&lon=654681.09&markerLat=7728628.13872784&markerLon=655309.1682911265&p=searchOptionsPanel&sok=Fl%C3%B8ya)
which is a popular launch spot on more SE wind.

I always look at this value before flying. Also here it is useful to look at
the history of values and not only at the last reading.


## Vind Nå ("wind now")
