If you are new to this area, it is a good idea and much safer and more fun to
team up with others and not fly alone. For this you can join one or more of the
[THPK club](http://thpk.no) Telegram groups:

- [THPK flyboks](https://t.me/joinchat/RF54vlM7r-WYjzLDKXSRAQ): here we coordinate airspace and announce opening and closing of "boxes"
- [THPK tur](https://t.me/joinchat/RF54vksjjQS4gElj209nDw): planning tours
- [THPK sosial](https://t.me/joinchat/RF54vk0dtg7zDEl0XeQN5w): social stuff
- [THPK skitprat](https://t.me/joinchat/RF54vkZFuDahxOvTG0-qAA): random talk

Since you have to [open the airspace](/airspace/) anyway, you need to do one of these two:
- join the [THPK flyboks Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/RF54vlM7r-WYjzLDKXSRAQ) and coordinate with others the airspace
- contact us on [THPK tur](https://t.me/joinchat/RF54vksjjQS4gElj209nDw), find somebody who will go flying with you and can do this for you
