If you are new to this area, it is a good idea and much safer and more fun to
team up with others and not fly alone. For this you can join one or more of the
[THPK club](https://thpk.no) [Signal](https://signal.org/) groups:

- [THPK flyboks](https://signal.group/#CjQKIEFDL9GndybrKwgfPps-LkFghgnxhFzaIF9Zd-1Jnz_FEhAR16FgrJSESTZabTtpZFmZ):
  here we coordinate airspace and announce opening and closing of "boxes"
- [THPK tur](https://signal.group/#CjQKIJ_gz3DQjvCh3qTG74awOoU1rdEDxuTCcTs11o_X38IYEhDiHoVqoUYUsQQ5GatUyfv_): planning tours
- [THPK sosial](https://signal.group/#CjQKIA-Xd_5k3rVvVQmBeMiXdunEhXjcYb8fAYeTSTS-opVMEhCBNyymyf7D5mKwfqqiXLZ6): social stuff
- [THPK skitprat](https://signal.group/#CjQKIEVLEg-Ir5f0l8G-TMN1WZuFOylB-UYZhjXd5HdmAWfSEhBQ4ZkmKPoJc9ODosCCQt--): random talk

Since you have to [open the airspace](@/airspace.md) anyway, you need to do one of these two:
- Join the "THPK flyboks" Signal group (link above) and coordinate the airspace
  with others.
- Contact us on the "THPK tur" Signal group (link above), find somebody who
  will go flying with you and can do this for you.
