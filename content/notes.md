# My own notes from two SIV courses

I wrote these down for me so that I don't lose them but maybe they are useful
for others, too.


## Big (big) ears

- First pull one, then the other
- Release both at the same time
- Pump out first one, then the other
- Start with the bigger tuck


## 360 constant cadence turn

- Outside brake arranges the angle
- In a tight 360 you can exit whenever you want


## Reserve packing

- Smooth side up (unless the bag dictates otherwise)
- One should not be able to lift the reserve container up by the lines


## Reserve deployment

- Look, locate, grasp, punch


## Safe exercises to try at home over dirt

- Pitch pendulum (dolphining)
- Weight-shift-only wing-overs
- Turn reversal (360 one way, 360 the other way, as fast and safe as possible)
- Constant cadence 360 banked one wingtip over the other


## Turn reversal

- Try reversing with weight-shift only
- Wait until the glider is in front


## Back-fly

- If you see wingtips inflating, let it go (hands up)
- Release not too slowly, otherwise helicopter
- Release symmetrically and rapidly
- If you get into a heli -> re-stall


## Stall

- Binary stall: down -> wait -> up
- 2-stage stall: stall, quickly open wingtips (raise hands to ca. shoulder height), quickly re-stall
- Stall stages: full stall -> back-fly -> parachutal/heli-phase -> out
- "If the body is alright, the glider is alright": Body position and hand symmetry is extremely important
- If the tips are out, release
- If it is already in front, release
- Slow down the glider and sit up to make the swing back nicer
- Control dive by releasing brakes and by providing friction
- If you get a turning exit, take it - do not re-stall it then


## Surge/dive

- Nice!
- Pendulum does all the work for you
- "Get out of jail free card"
- Keep going the same way -> "No threat whatsoever!"
- Speed is maneuvrability


## Spin/ search for spin

- Keep going the same way


## Wing-overs

- Weight-shift on top
- Turn when diving
- Better earlier than later (brake in the dive, not later)
- Optimal brake input is 5 o'clock (just before 6 o'clock which is under the glider)
- Add outside brake
- On the way up squeeze inside break a bit longer to yaw the glider around to face the ground
- Hands up when starting to dive
- Throw the glider around: you want to achieve a "slingshot"/throw effect


## Wing-over outside collapse recovery

- Do not let it turn you, do not outside brake
- Continue same way
- Keep inside brake and it will come out
- Keep turn and go into 360


## SAT

- Strong weight-shift
- One arm is the "rod": "rod" holds risers, no need to push
- "Rod" to one side, weigh-shift to the other side
- One cannot go to SAT from a spiral
- Squeeze brake and pull through once it is dropping
- One or two wraps are needed
- With a normal glider, once in SAT, you cannot slow it down too much
- Possible outcomes:
  - Too slow/ bad timing: spiral
  - Good timing: SAT
  - Too fast/ too hard: spin/coconut -> stall it
- Exit: relax rod -> spiral -> spiral exit


## Spiral exit

- Do not weigh-shift out
- Keep weight-shift
- Slowly release inside brake
- If no effect, add outside brake
- If no effect, jab both brakes
- If no effect, weight-shift to neutral
- Jab both brakes
- If no effect, reserve
- Once wing comes out of deep spiral, add inside brake and weight-shift again to bleed energy


## 360 spin "amp max"

- One arm up, one arm buried
- Release when in front
- Don't interfere with it
- When you see the ground, you can let go


## Trim speed

- Typically around 37 km/h


## Flying under a half-collapsed wing

- More wing-loading
- But also more drag


## Cliff flying

- Weight-shift away from cliff
- As much weight-shift as possible
- As little brake as you can get away with


## U-turn vision (observations)

- Back-fly position: hand through the brake-loop pinching about brake-loop -
  position is that I could put thumbs through carabiners
- Accelerated full frontal can stall into back-fly/deep stall, if the hands are not completely up after collapse
- Asymmetric 360 collapse leaning into the collapse goes rapidly into a SAT-like rotation
